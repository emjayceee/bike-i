For years, bicycles have been used as a sustainable mode of transportation to promote a healthy lifestyle and lessen carbon footprint. Many countries have incorporated bike lanes to their roads to encourage individuals to consider using bicycles. Providing a designated safe space for cyclists encourages individuals to consider using bicycles for everyday travel.  In the Philippines, there is a lack of information on bike lane networks prompting the researchers to seize the opportunity to bridge this gap and make a significant contribution. This study aimed to develop a mobile application that highlights the bike lanes in Metro Manila with the use of the A* algorithm, a pathfinding algorithm, and Googleâ€™s API which offers a variety of resources for route and navigation.

The app was mainly developed using Android Studio; and Firebase was incorporated, which served as the database of the application. The Bike-I app offers features for bike lane searching, voice navigation (Text-to-Speech), accident reports, and bike lane route navigation. From the results of the evaluation conducted, in which 51 respondents participated in using the mobile application, Bike-I app achieved an overall result of Excellent as verbal interpretation. This proves that the Bike-I application is effective and useful and can contribute to the safety and well-being of bike users.
